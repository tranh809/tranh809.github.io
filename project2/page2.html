	<p align="center">
	<span style="opacity:0.3;">José Palacios, his oldest servant, found him</span>
	<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">floating naked with his eyes open</span>
	<span style="opacity:0.3;">in the purifying waters of his bath and thought</span>
	<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">he had drowned</span>. 
	<span style="opacity:0.3;">He knew this was one of the many ways the General</span>
	<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">meditated</span>, 
	<span style="opacity:0.3;">but the</span> 
	<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">ecstasy in which he lay drifting</span>
	<span style="opacity:0.3;">seemed that of</span>
	<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">a man no longer of this world.</span>
</p>
	
	<p align="center">
	<span style="opacity:0.3;">He did not</span>
	<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">dare come closer</span> 
	<span style="opacity:0.3;">but called to him </span>
	<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">in a hushed voice</span>
	<span style="opacity:0.3;">, complying with the order </span>
	<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">to awaken him before five so they could leave at dawn.</span> 
	<span style="opacity:0.3;">The General came out of </span>
	<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">his trance</span> 
	<span style="opacity:0.3;">and saw</span>
	<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">in the half-light the clear blue eyes</span>
	<span style="opacity:0.3;">, the curly squirrel-colored hair, </span>
	<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">the impassive dignity</span>
	<span style="opacity:0.3;">of the steward who attended him every day and who </span>
	<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">held in his hand</span> 
	<span style="opacity:0.3;">a cup of the curative infusion of poppies and gum arabic. The General's hands </span>
	<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">lacked strength</span> 
	<span style="opacity:0.3;">when he grasped the handles of the tub, </span>
	<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">but he rose up from the</span> 
	<span style="opacity:0.3;">medicinal </span>
	<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">waters</span> 
	<span style="opacity:0.3;">in a dolphinlike rush that was surprising in </span>
	<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">so wasted a body.</span>
	<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">"Let's go," he said, "as fast as we can. No one loves us here."</span>
