		For this project, I recreated the Tumblr blog I had back when I was about 14. As some of you may relate, middle school was a confusing and frustrating experience. They were the couple of years that were meant to prepare you for high school but in reality, they really didn't. It was a point in time when adults, boys, sex-ed and social standards freaked you out. You start to bottle these overwhelming emotions of awkward anger and before you know it, you become an angsty teen. Being a hot mess as I was (and still am), I didn't know where I stood as an individual and the only way to relate to other people was to reblog blogs from bloggers who reblog from other bloggers. As unoriginal and concerning as it sounds, it felt comforting back then. To be able to personalize my own tumblr and post about relatable things were fulfilling.

		Therefore, in this project, I shared several phases I went through on Tumblr that can be interpreted as a timeline throughout middleschool. These phases include posts on my old blog that represent certain emotions I felt or even things I found profoundly funny. Looking back, I can say it's a little insane but so is growing up. Hope you guys like it! And don't forget to give your girl a follow :)
