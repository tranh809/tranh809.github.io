<h1 align="center">About A.W.A.N</h1>
<p>A.W.A.N. is a small, yet growing, grass roots rescue group located in Ulster County, "the gateway to the Catskill mountains" at Woodstock, New York.

They have a 20-year history and a 501c(3) status. The heart of their mission is the fostering of cats in A.W.A.N. network homes until loving adoptions can be arranged.

Most of their budget pays vets for spay/neuter, rehabilitation of abused animals, and support of special needs animals.

They encourage no-kill shelters. Sad to say, whenever an area shelter goes no-kill, their modest resources are stretched even thinner, as the rejects are dumped, surrendered to them, or left to starve.

A.W.A.N., in its hands-on way, gives shelter and sanctuary while fighting the ancient battle against cruelty, ignorance, and indifference. They need help to continue and expand their effort. Every day, more unwanteds are born to lives of horrific neglect and pain.
